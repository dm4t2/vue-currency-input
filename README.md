# Vue Currency Input
The Vue Currency Input plugin allows an easy input of currency formatted numbers. It provides both a standalone component (`<currency-input>`) and a custom Vue directive (`v-currency`) for decorating existing input components with currency format capabilities.

[Read the guide](https://dm4t2.github.io/vue-currency-input/guide/) to getting started or check out the [playground](https://dm4t2.github.io/vue-currency-input/playgound/) to see it in action.

## Features

* **Lightweight:** [Tiny bundle size](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=vue-currency-input) and zero dependencies.
* **Format as you type:** Numbers are formatted immediately during input.
* **i18n support:** Language-dependent, ISO-compliant currency formatting using the native [Intl.NumberFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NumberFormat).
* **Distraction free:** Enables easier input by hiding various parts of the formatting on focus.
* **Fully customizable:** Use custom currency symbols, precision ranges and [much more](https://dm4t2.github.io/vue-currency-input/config/).
