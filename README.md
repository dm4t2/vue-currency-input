# Vue Currency Input

[![](docs/vue-currency-input.gif)](https://dm4t2.github.io/vue-currency-input)

Vue Currency Input allows an easy input of currency formatted numbers based on the [ECMAScript Internationalization API (Intl.NumberFormat)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat).

Built on top of the [Vue Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html), it enables you to decorate _any_ input component with currency format capabilities.

## Features

- Turns the input component of your favorite framework (for example [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/text-fields/), [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/vue-components/input) or [Element Plus](https://element-plus.org/en-US/component/input.html)) into a currency input field
- Supports both Vue 2 _and_ Vue 3
- Built on standards: Ensures the right locale dependent formatting by using [Intl.NumberFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat)
- Unobtrusive input by hiding the formatting on focus
- Built-in value range validation
